Crystal Collector Game

## What is it?
The Crystal Collector Game is a basic guessing game built with Bootstrap and Jquery.  It challenges a player to click on the right combination of crystals to match the score provided for that round.  

## Rules of the game
1. Computer generates a random number for the player to match
2. Each crystal is assigned a random value that is hidden to the player
3. As the player clicks on a crystal, the hidden value is added to the player's score.  
4. The player can see their score increase and derive the hidden value of each crystal.
5. The player wins the game if they match the random number chosen by the computer.
6. The player loses the game if their score goes over the computer's randomly chosen number.
7. After win/loss, a new game is started and wins/losses are tracked on the scoreboard.
8. When a new game is started, new random numbers are assigned to the crystals and the computer chooses a new random number to match.
